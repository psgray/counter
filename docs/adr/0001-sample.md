# ADR 0001: Use Flutter

## Context
We need a cross-platform framework for mobile, web, and desktop apps.

## Decision
We chose **Flutter** because:
- Strong community and support
- Single codebase for multiple platforms
- Good developer experience

## Status
Accepted

## Consequences
- Development requires Dart
- CI/CD pipelines must support multiple OS targets
