# ðŸ“š Project Documentation

This folder contains all project-related documentation.

## Structure
- `adr/` â€” Architectural Decision Records
- `setup/` â€” Setup guides per platform
- `ci-cd/` â€” CI/CD workflows and release notes
- `design/` â€” UI/UX design notes
- `troubleshooting.md` â€” Common problems and solutions

Create a /notes folder in the project root,
as listed in .gitignore,
to hold your local developer notes and data,
and to avoid cluttering the project's main docs.
